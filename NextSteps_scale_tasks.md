> Now I've modified all the necessary scripts to use the data/processed_images.json file:

### 1. scripts/run_all_attacks.sh
• Already updated to use jq to parse the JSON file
• Extracts images for each task from the JSON file
• Runs attacks only on those specific images

### 2. scripts/select_attack.py
• Added code to load and validate the processed_images.json file
• Verifies that the processed images exist in the attack directories
• Provides warnings and options to proceed if images are missing

### 3. scripts/eval_model.py
• Added a load_processed_images() function to read the JSON file
• Modified prepare_ground_truth_files() to filter ground truth data by the images in processed_images.json
• Updated run_evaluation() to only process questions related to images in processed_images.json

### 4. scripts/eval_vqa.py
• No changes needed as this script processes the results after they've been generated

These changes ensure that all scripts in the pipeline will only process the images specified in the data/processed_images.json 
file, making the evaluation more focused and efficient.
