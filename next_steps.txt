## Finding the Optimal Balance

Our experiments have revealed a fundamental trade-off between creating adversarial perturbations that are imperceptible to humans and ensuring they're effective at degrading VLM performance. Here are five strategies to find the optimal balance:

### 1. Adaptive Perturbation Magnitude

Implement an adaptive approach that incrementally increases perturbation magnitude until finding the threshold where model performance begins to degrade. This could involve:
- Starting with minimal perturbations (e.g., max pixel change of 5)
- Gradually increasing magnitude in small increments (e.g., +2 per iteration)
- Testing model performance at each step
- Stopping when SSIM drops below 0.95 or when performance degradation reaches a target level

### 2. Semantic Region Targeting

Focus perturbations more aggressively on the most semantically important regions while keeping changes minimal elsewhere:
- Use more sophisticated methods to identify critical regions (text, data points, axes in charts)
- Apply stronger perturbations to these regions while keeping overall image SSIM high
- Experiment with different amplification factors for important vs. non-important regions
- Use OCR to specifically target text elements with higher precision

### 3. Perceptual Optimization

Optimize perturbations based on human perceptual models rather than just mathematical metrics:
- Incorporate LPIPS (Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity) alongside SSIM
- Exploit known limitations in human visual perception (e.g., less sensitivity to changes in high-frequency patterns)
- Use perceptual hashing algorithms to ensure hash similarity while maximizing attack effectiveness
- Consider color space transformations that are less perceptible to humans but affect model performance

### 4. Model-Specific Attack Customization

Tailor attacks to exploit specific vulnerabilities in different VLM architectures:
- Develop separate attack parameters for different models (GPT-4o vs. Qwen25_VL_3B)
- Use transfer learning to identify which perturbations transfer best between models
- Probe model attention patterns to identify where each model focuses most
- Create hybrid attacks that combine techniques effective against different architectures

### 5. Adversarial Feature Manipulation

Instead of pixel-level perturbations, manipulate higher-level features that VLMs rely on:
- Target specific chart elements (e.g., slightly modify data point positions or values)
- Introduce subtle inconsistencies between visual elements and their textual descriptions
- Modify relative relationships between elements rather than absolute values
- Create perturbations that preserve visual appearance but alter semantic meaning

## Most Promising ART Black-box Attacks
https://github.com/Trusted-AI/adversarial-robustness-toolbox

Based on our analysis of the Adversarial Robustness Toolbox (ART) v1.19, the following black-box attacks show particular promise for balancing imperceptibility and effectiveness:

### 1. HopSkipJump Attack (Chen et al., 2019)
- Particularly well-suited for balancing imperceptibility and effectiveness
- Uses a direction-based sampling approach that minimizes the L2 norm of perturbations
- Adaptively adjusts step sizes to find decision boundaries efficiently
- Could be modified to target semantically important regions in charts/diagrams

### 2. Geometric Decision-based Attack (GeoDA) (Rahmati et al., 2020)
- One of the newest and most sophisticated black-box attacks
- Uses geometric information to find minimal perturbations
- Particularly effective at creating imperceptible perturbations
- Works well with high-dimensional inputs like images

### 3. Square Attack (Andriushchenko et al., 2020)
- Uses random search with square-shaped updates
- Highly query-efficient while maintaining good imperceptibility
- Can be easily modified to focus on specific image regions
- Performs well even with strict perturbation constraints

### 4. Simple Black-box Adversarial (SimBA) (Guo et al., 2019)
- Iteratively perturbs pixels or low-frequency components
- Naturally creates imperceptible perturbations
- Can be adapted to target specific image features
- Particularly effective against vision models

## Implementation Considerations for VLMs

For vision-language models specifically, we recommend:

### 1. Combining GeoDA with semantic targeting
- Use our semantic importance map to guide GeoDA's search direction
- Focus perturbations on chart elements, text, and data points
- Implement weighted perturbation based on semantic importance

### 2. Adapting HopSkipJump with perceptual constraints
- Incorporate SSIM thresholds into the HopSkipJump algorithm
- Implement early stopping when perceptual similarity drops below threshold
- Use adaptive step sizes based on region importance

### 3. Enhancing Square Attack for chart-specific attacks
- Modify the square selection probability to prioritize regions with text/data
- Use smaller squares in text regions and larger squares in background areas
- Implement multi-scale square selection based on feature importance

These approaches would likely achieve a better balance between imperceptibility and effectiveness than our current implementations, as they're specifically designed to find minimal perturbations that cross decision boundaries - exactly what we need for effective yet imperceptible attacks against VLMs.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Short-term**: 
   - Implement HopSkipJump and GeoDA attacks from ART library
   - Modify these attacks to incorporate our semantic importance maps
   - Evaluate performance against both GPT-4o and Qwen25_VL_3B

2. **Mid-term**: 
   - Develop hybrid approaches combining semantic targeting with Square Attack and SimBA
   - Create a comprehensive evaluation framework to measure both imperceptibility and effectiveness
   - Implement adaptive parameter tuning based on model feedback

3. **Long-term**: 
   - Create a unified framework that automatically selects the optimal attack strategy based on image content and target model
   - Develop model-specific attack variants optimized for different VLM architectures
   - Explore defenses against these attacks to better understand VLM vulnerabilities

## Evaluation Metrics

To properly evaluate the balance between imperceptibility and effectiveness, we should track:
- SSIM (structural similarity)
- LPIPS (perceptual similarity)
- Human detection rate (through user studies)
- Model performance degradation percentage
- Attack success rate (% of examples where model performance is degraded)
- Query efficiency (number of model queries required for successful attack)
- Transferability (effectiveness across different models)
