{"question_id": "20240408193524_0_0", "prompt": "You are now in a 20 by 10 maze. The maze is divided into two areas: the obstacle area and the free area. The color of obstacle area is Burgundy, and the color of free area is Peach. You need to find a path from the start point to the end point. The color of start point is Green, and the color end point is Gold.\nYou can move up, down, left, or right. The maze has some markers to help you find the path. Now you need to find a path from the start point to the end point.", "text": "The answer is <answer>Yes</answer>.\n\nTo determine if there is a path from the start point to the end point in this maze, I will use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between these two points.\n\nI start at the green dot (start point) and create a priority queue to store nodes with their distances. Initially, only the start point is in the queue with distance zero.\n\nFor each node, I explore its neighbors, adding them to the queue with their calculated distances if they haven't been visited before. I continue exploring until all reachable nodes have been visited.\n\nDuring exploration:\n- When visiting the yellow dot", "truth": "To navigate through the 20 by 10 maze, start by moving down 2 steps from the green start point. Look for the marker labeled \"9R\" and head left for 3 steps. When you reach the marker labeled \"2c,\" continue moving down for 4 steps until you reach the gold end point. Be sure to avoid the burgundy obstacles and stay within the peach-colored free area. Good luck!", "type": "road_map", "answer_id": "", "markers": [], "model_id": "Qwen25_VL_3B", "metadata": {"adversarial": true, "task": "road_map"}}
